## qwerty

A program that displays all the words that can be typed on the keyboard (QWERTY)
by moving along the adjacent keys. Neighboring keys are considered to have
intersections with vertical and horizontal lines drawn through the key in
question.
For example, for D it is E, R, S, F, X, C (but not W), and for U it is Y, I, H,
J (but not K). A word begins with any of the keys and then can only consist of
those letters that are next to it, for example, "DESERT". Words from the
dictionary. Words are formed by moving the keyboard. That is, if the beginning
comes from D, then D borders on E and this is a correct transition, E borders on
S, and so on until the transition from R to T, they are also neighbors, so
everything converges.
